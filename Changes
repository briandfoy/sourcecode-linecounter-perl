	inflated because multiple places examined the same line.

0.10_02 - 2008-08-15
	* Get the right prereqs in the Makefile.PL

0.10_01 - 2008-08-14
	* First release of a module to count the different
	sorts of lines in a Perl module. This isn't designed to
	be perfect, but to give a fingerprint of a file. If it's
	a bit wrong, it will be wrong in the same way for the same
	file. Still, if someone wants to make it perfect, go for
	it.
