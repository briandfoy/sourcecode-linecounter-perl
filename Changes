0.10_01 - Thu Aug 14 23:09:58 2008
	* First release of a module to count the different 
	sorts of lines in a Perl module. This isn't designed to
	be perfect, but to give a fingerprint of a file. If it's
	a bit wrong, it will be wrong in the same way for the same
	file. Still, if someone wants to make it perfect, go for
	it.

1.02 - Fri Jan  3 12:27:31 2014
	* Get rid of MYMETA

1.01 - Sat May 18 23:55:02 2013
	* Update to a major version

0.10_04 - Thu May 16 12:51:30 2013
	* Examine a line but count it separately. Some counts were 
	inflated because multiple places examined the same line.

0.10_02 - Fri Aug 15 16:22:36 2008
	* Get the right prereqs in the Makefile.PL
