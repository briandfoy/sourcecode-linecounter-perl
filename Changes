0.10_01 - Thu Aug 14 23:09:58 2008
	* First release of a module to count the different 
	sorts of lines in a Perl module. This isn't designed to
	be perfect, but to give a fingerprint of a file. If it's
	a bit wrong, it will be wrong in the same way for the same
	file. Still, if someone wants to make it perfect, go for
	it.

0.10_02 - Fri Aug 15 16:22:36 2008
	* Get the right prereqs in the Makefile.PL
